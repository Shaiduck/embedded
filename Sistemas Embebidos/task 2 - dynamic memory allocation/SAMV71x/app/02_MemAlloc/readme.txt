This file describes how to use the Atmel SAMV71 getting_started (template) project:

This example was created and test using the following envrionment:
-IDE: winIDEA/winIDEA Open
-Compiler: arm-none-eabi version 4.9
-Target HW: SAMV7 Xplained Ultra

Requirements:
- Debug HW: Onboard CMSIS-DAP, iSYSTEM iTag50
- Atmel SAMV71 Xplained Kit

Function:
The demonstration program makes two LEDs on the board blink at a fixed rate.
This rate is generated by using Time tick timer. The blinking can be stopped
by typing '1' or '2' in the console (one for each LED) - but requires a UART
communication with the following parameters:

- 115200 baud rates, 8 bits of data, No parity, 1 stop bit, No flow control

Project specific source/header files:

    - main.c                             Main program file

In order to use the example program, perform the following steps:

 + winIDEA
    - Open one of the following preconfigured project workspaces:
         - FreeRTOS_Blinky_gcc_itag50.xjrf (iSYSTEM iTag50) 
		 - FreeRTOS_Demo_gcc_itag50.xjrf (iSYSTEM iTag50)
      under File->Workspace->Open_Workspace 
    - Rebuild all files: Project->Rebuild (optional)
    - Load project image: Debug->Download
    - Run program: Debug->Run Control->Run (F5)
